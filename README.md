# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This application is made to help users receive random affirmations and mantras with the press of a button. It is intended to provide those may a form of emotional and mental support with a solution. Users are easily able to select multiple affirmations and mantras to display from varied lists of them.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Clone down the repo using GitHub. GitHub provides a link which can be used in the terminal after typing ```github clone <cloned link from GitHub>```.

2. Enter the respective directory in the terminal. Then type ```open index.html``` to open the website in an internet browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

The following screenshot shows what happens if a user were to select the buttons to receive a mantra. The application successfully displays a mantra out of a list of pre-determined mantras.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We were given five days to work on the project. However, I started working on this project two days before the final submission deadline. I attribute the decision to start working on the project later to personal life stressors that made it difficult for me to focus on the project timeline. I am three weeks into Mod 1 of the front-end engineering program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set
- Use knowledge of DOM structuring to organize code

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins:
- Able to display website element according to styles specified in the project specifications page.
- Got the website to display randomly-selected mantras and affirmations.

#### Challenges:
- Had a considerable amount of trouble with starting the project. After acknowledging and addressing the anxiety I was facing when I was getting closer to the deadline, I came to the conclusion that my best effort would be better than no effort. I was able to complete the first two iterations of the project after that.
- I was unable to successfully implement code for my chosen CYOA feature. I plan to overcome a similar challenge again in the future by implementing better time management practices.
